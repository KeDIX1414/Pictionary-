		<h1> Let's Play Pictionary </h1>
		<p> INSTRUCTIONS:  
      		<ol>
        		<li> In this game, you and your partner will take turns drawing pictures and guessing what your partner is drawing. Each round will last for one minute.
        		<li> When you are the drawer, you will be told an image to draw at the beginning of the round. Draw this image in the canvas using your cursor. The round will end if your partner guesses correctly. If your partner guesses incorrectly, you will be alerted and told what they guessed.
        		<li> When you are the guesser, look at what your partner draws on the canvas. When you think you know what the image is, write your guess in the textbox. You will be todl whether or not you guessed correctly or incorrectly.
