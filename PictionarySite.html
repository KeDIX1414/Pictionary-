		<h1> Word Game </h1>
		<p><strong> Instructions: Read This First  
      		<ol style = "width:1000px;">
        		<li> In this game, you and your partner will take turns drawing pictures and guessing what the other is drawing. Each round lasts one minute.
        		<li> When you’re the DRAWER, you’ll be given a word to draw on the screen. 
You will see your partner's guesses as they make them. You can keep drawing until they get it right or the minute is up.
 
        		<li> When you’re the GUESSER, watch your partner's drawing appear.  
Guess what it is by writing your guess in the text box and pressing Enter. (Don’t write extra words! For example, write “popsicle”, not “I think it’s a popsicle”.) 
				<li> The game will tell you if you get it right. Keep guessing until you do, or the minute is up.
				<li> After the minute is up, you’ll start a new round. In the new round you may have the same partner or a different one. We’ll tell you if you’re switching partners, and whether you’re the DRAWER or the GUESSER.
